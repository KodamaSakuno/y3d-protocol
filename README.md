#  :satellite: Y3D Protocol :satellite:

## TL;DR:

Y3D = [YAM](https://yam.finance) + [P3D](https://powh.io)

## How it works?

We add POWH algorithm into liquidity mining. 
Unlike the origin POWH algorithm, there is no fee when stake, but when weak hand decided to unstake their LP token, there will be an additional 5% fees which will be divide to all other miner as their POSH.
